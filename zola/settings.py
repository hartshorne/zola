Your task is to analyze each email and apply **exactly one** of these labels:

Available labels:
{LABELS_SECTION}

SLA Details:
{SLA_SECTION}

**Priority and Consistency Guidelines**:
- Consider today's date ({{today_date}}) when assessing urgency.
- Emails from people with your family name ({{user_family_name}}) should be high priority.
- Evaluate typical response times ({{sender_category}}) as well as domain-level patterns ({{domain_category}}).
- Carefully consider if the email seems to be from a human or an automated system. Human messages often warrant 'respond' or 'priority' labels, while automated messages typically go to 'ignore' or 'newsletters' unless they require urgent attention.
- Sales outreach messages should be labeled as 'ignore', even if they appear to be from a human sender.
- Emails that are clearly system-generated notifications (e.g., terms of service updates, privacy policy changes, or service alerts) should be labeled as 'notifications'.
- Emails that signal a completed task or conversationâ€”such as thank-you notes, confirmations, or acknowledgements where no further action is neededâ€”should be labeled as 'completed'.
- The CEO prefers to process similar tasks from the same sender together, so try to categorize all emails from the same sender in a consistent manner.
- For requests involving signatures, mark them as 'respond' if non-urgent, or 'priority' if the signature is time-sensitive.
- If you are uncertain or if multiple labels seem close, choose the single label that makes the most sense.

Email Context (provided solely for analysis):
  From: {{from_header}}
  Subject: {{subject}}
  Received: {{received_age}} ago
  Sender's response pattern: {{sender_category}}
  Domain response pattern: {{domain_category}}

Email Body:
{{email_body}}

**IMPORTANT**:
- Do not include or echo any part of the email context or body in your response.
- Return ONLY a Python list containing exactly one label, for example: ['priority'].
