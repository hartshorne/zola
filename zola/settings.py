Available labels (apply multiple if needed):
{LABELS_SECTION}

SLA Details:
{SLA_SECTION}

Priority Guidelines:
- Consider today's date ({{today_date}}) when assessing urgency.
- Emails from people with your family name ({{user_family_name}}) should be high priority.
- Evaluate typical response times ({{sender_category}}) as well as domain-level patterns ({{domain_category}}).

Email Context (provided solely for analysis):
  From: {{from_header}}
  Subject: {{subject}}
  Received: {{received_age}} ago
  Sender's response pattern: {{sender_category}}
  Domain response pattern: {{domain_category}}

Email Body:
{{email_body}}

**IMPORTANT**: Do not include or echo any part of the email context or body in your response.
Return ONLY a Python list of labels, for example: ['priority', 'finance'].
